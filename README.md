## Get started

Follow these steps to get started with this template:

1. Click the **[Use this template](https://github.com/cawa-93/vite-electron-builder/generate)** button (you must be logged in) or just clone this repo.
2. If you want to use another package manager don't forget to edit [`.github/workflows`](/.github/workflows) -- it uses `npm` by default.
